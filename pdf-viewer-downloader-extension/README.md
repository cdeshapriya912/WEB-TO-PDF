# PDF Viewer Downloader Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that captures PDF viewer pages (specifically those using canvas-based rendering like pdf-vue3) and downloads them as PDF files.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects PDF viewer pages with canvas elements
- ðŸ“„ **Multi-page support**: Captures all pages from the PDF viewer
- ðŸ’¾ **High-quality output**: Preserves original canvas resolution in the PDF
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive popup interface
- âš¡ **Fast processing**: Efficient canvas-to-PDF conversion
- ðŸ”§ **Customizable**: Choose your own filename

## How It Works

This extension works by:
1. Detecting PDF viewer pages that use canvas elements (like pdf-vue3)
2. Capturing each canvas as a high-resolution image
3. Converting all canvas images into a single PDF file
4. Downloading the PDF to your computer

## Installation

2. Follow Method 1 steps 2-6

## Usage

1. **Navigate to a PDF viewer page** (like the one you showed me with canvas elements)
2. **Click the extension icon** in your Chrome toolbar
3. **Wait for detection** - the extension will show how many pages it found

## Troubleshooting

### "No PDF viewer detected"
